read registers from the arduino with:
mb.Hreg(address)

but the issue is that you can only use the com port one at a time, so you cant read register values on the arduino while 
writing values to the registers in daqfactory.

theres an issue with the baudrates again. when setting the serial to a baudrate of 9600, daqfactory will not recognize the
arduino whatsoever, the only way for it to recognize is at 115200 baudrate. this is an issue because the serial baudrate on
the arduino is fixed at 9600, therefore its impossible to access the serial ports and send/recieve data from the arduino.

In DAQFactory with the baudrate on 115200, there are constant ModbusRTU errors that i cant fix when you open and close the valves.
the error is caught on the line: device.SWAS.setRegisterS16(case_id,200,timestamp1 & timestamp_mask) however when using the 
command line, this code works perfectly fine. It catches errors aswell sometimes on the device.SWAS.forceCoil(case_id,0,0) line
and i have no idea why.
