have to use the signed 16 bit holding registers, as they are the only registers that you can write to multiple registers with one instruction

however this means that there are errors when storing the timestamps in these registers, as the first bit is signed
therefore need to do a signed to unsigned conversion: signed ->unsigned = signed_value + (max_int_value) + 1
where max_int_value in this case is 2^16 = 65536

4 registers to store the correct timestamps,
 - 2 of them to store open-valve timestamp
 - 2 of them to store close-valve timestamp

due to the signed issue, when accessing the holding registers to obtain the timestamps, you need to first convert from signed to unsigned.

created a timestamp sequence, which when called, stores the current time in either the open-valve text field, or the close-valve text field
depending on wether the valve is already opened or closed
(simple if/else block)

working combobox, that changes the case_id instead of having to type the digits

text field which calculates the period the valve was open for, by reading from all 4 of the timestamp registers and using maths to convert
everything to seconds, and then subtracts valve_open_timestamp from valve_close_timestamp
unixtime/60/60/24 = time elapsed since 1070-01-01 in days

adafruit SD card shield fits fine on the arduino mega, but the correct ports are in the wrong place for some reason. turns out you need to
use jumper cables to connect the right ports, so theres no point doing anything until i get a working was arduino shield board.

compiler segmentation errors which stopped me from adding more than 17 holding registers, in the arduino code.
Fix found: https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=572746.0

tried to make a variable associated with case_id that counts how many times the valve has been opened, however this didnt work and i realized
that you can just get that info from the log files anyway
