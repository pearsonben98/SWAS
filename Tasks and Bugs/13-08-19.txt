SWAS_WASP_2_2 - most recent up to date working file.

Now when you connect to a new case, if the case is completely fresh and there is no content on the SD card, nothing will happen.

However if theres a new case connected but there is data stored on the SD card, this data will then be backed up locally on the 
control box to a .csv file. Every time you launch daqfactory and connect to a case, the local file will be compared to the SD card 
file, and if there are any new records, the .csv file will be updated with the new information.



Needs to be done tomorrow: 

SWAS_WASP_3 is just a copy of SWAS_WASP_2 and needs to be used to test functionality of using 2 SWAS cases at the same time. 

on the control box, create arduino software that can recognize the trigger input using a simple modbus program to read the value
of a coil. The trigger is connected to pin 9 on the lattepanda arduino. On startup, set the coil to high. when the button is pressed
the coil will drop to 0, and the trigger is active low.
