the arduino file in pears/documents/uni timestamp works properly. however in daqfactory need to go to the timestamp sequence
and uncomment the two setregister lines, aswell as commenting out the setmultiple registers line.


the arduino file with the same name but in the git repository is the updated version, however there it doesnt work properly with
storing the array into the registers. it wont let me create a text file inside the if (prev< whatever) loop. so on monday need to get
that to work.
