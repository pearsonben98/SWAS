two functions in the arduino file which enable the arduino to read a specific line from a file on the SD card, extract the 
information and then stores the information in the correct register locations. these registers can then be read by DAQfactory,
in order to store all the information in a table format.


Currently i am in the process of getting the table to work. i think you need a 2d array to store the data in the table correctly




to check if it works, load daqfactory and connect to case5.

then do ?array to check value of the array.

then, device.swas.setregisters16(5,106,any number)

then read registers 201-232. they should contain the details from the line you selected from the sd card





made a sequence called filltable which is supposed to store the contents of the array into another 2d array, and then the 
table in theory should display the contents of the 2d array
