things to do:

add blue colour for unknown status

add hover over button description of colour and show pressure









green means been evacuated, ready to be filled on plane, flight number = 0

red means is filled by aircraft software and given flight number

yellow means been a bit has been sampled, but more might remain based on pressure


if its red or yelow you should be able to sample the case, 


red->yellow

yellow->evacuate->green

plane software turns from green->red


if plane software is ran and case is yellow or red you cant do anything








Bugs:

SD card still gets double filled everytime you launch DAQFactory.

The SD card doesnt log the last action, only the second to last action for some weird reason. If you press
a button 6 times, it will only log 5 presses.




















make time stamp in DF human readable
