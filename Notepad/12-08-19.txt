Task:


	In DAQFactory, firstly, when connecting to a case, DAQfactory should read a text file named 'case_id.txt' which is stored somewhere
	on the pc. If it doesnt exist, create the file. Load the contents of this text file into an array in DAQfactory called 'file_array'.

	Then, read the most recent 100 records from the SD card in the arduino, and store this in table_array. compare table_array to the 
	last 100 records on file_array. Then, inside a for loop from (0 to table_array.size) 
	
	
		for(i to table_array.size (100 in this case) ){

			if (table_array[i][timestamp] > file_array[last_element][timestamp]){	
	
				write table_array[i][] into file_array[last element + 1][]

			}

		}
