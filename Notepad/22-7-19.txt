__________________________DAQFactory____________________________
fixed the issue with the boards. in the SWAS_V1.ino file there was an argument missing in the modbus configuration function.
Old: mb.config(&Serial1,115200, SERIAL_8N1);
Fixed: mb.config(&Serial1,115200, SERIAL_8N1, 2); <- the ,2 was missing


Initially, tried using two U16 registers with a mask and bit shifting to store the timestamps correctly. 
so i would create a 32 bit variable, which stores the timestamp.
Then, i needed to make a mask that only takes the least significant bits of the timestamp.
mask = 0x0000FFFF  <- the first 4 zeros are the first 16 bits in hex, and the FFFF represents 16 logic 1's
therefore using the bitwise & operator, "timestamp & mask" will only read the 16 LSB's.

Then, you can use bit-shifting to shift the timestamp across 16 bits. "timestamp >> 16"
and then do the mask thing again, this will leave you with the 16 MSB's.

However, due to DAQfactory not being able to write to the U16 registers. i had to simply use one U32 register instead


_________________________SD Card________________________________
Using the Datalogger arduino example, it is possible to create text files however when copying the code and adding it to the
USBswas_v1 file it doesnt work. I think its something to do with trying to configure the modbus at the same time.

for the readWrite.ino example, the cardInfo.ino file and all the other examples. need to set chipSelect to 53, as this is the
correct pin to use for the arduino MEGA.

Fixed the above issue. Its something to do with the timing of the arduino's function calls. because the modbus was operating at 
a baudrate of 115200, and the Serial was operating at a baudrate of 9600, this caused timing issues and for the serial to print
a bunch of jargon. So change the mb.config baudrate to 9600 and it will work correctly with the SD card.
