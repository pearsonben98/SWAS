Reading and writing to/from the SD card on the arduino works fine in the main program, but the arduino is supposed to be able to read the 
registers in order to write the information to the SD card. Currently, the arduino can only create the registers, and DAQFactory puts 
data into the registers and reads from them. 

Need to find a way to get the Arduino to read from the registers correctly
