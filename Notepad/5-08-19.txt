Bugs:

When launching daqfactory, connecting to the case and opening and closing some valves, this all works fine. However the table only
shows the most recent record. Table only works properly after a restart of daqfactory

Still the first time i open a valve, the values arent stored correctly to the SD card, just a bunch of 0's

when connecting to the case, it takes a few attempts to be able to connect properly which is annoying but not a priority




to do:

button depressed 

turn table into tab delimited file to store on pc, which can then be backed up on google drive

when clicking on case connect, display the table, make a progress bar, use a loading bar thing
